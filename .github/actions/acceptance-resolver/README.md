# Acceptance Resolver

The resolver behind ADR-040. It joins the fork-owned service descriptor
(`.spi/service.yaml`, schema v3) with the stack's facts envelope
(`spi info --json`, `apiVersion: spi.osdu.dev/v1`) and caller-supplied Key
Vault secret values into the environment map an acceptance suite runs with —
an `.env` file suitable for `docker run --env-file` (Maven does not read this file directly).

This document is the resolver's contract. The source vocabulary, precedence,
exit codes, and report schema below are frozen: descriptors in every service
fork, the deploy lane, and the developer loop all depend on them, so changes
here are breaking changes.

## Boundaries

- **The resolver never calls Azure or the cluster.** Facts and secret values
  arrive as files. The caller saves `spi info --json` to disk and, when the
  descriptor names Key Vault secrets, fetches those values (e.g. one
  `az keyvault secret show` per name in the `secret_names` output) into a
  JSON file of name → value. Fetch only when `keyvault_name` is non-empty:
  an empty name beside a non-empty `secret_names` means the environment has
  not published its vault — skip the fetch and let `run` mode refuse with
  typed misses naming each secret and the unpublished fact.
- **Standard library only.** No `pip install` at runtime. The resolved
  environment must be a function of the descriptor, the facts, the secrets
  file, and the caller's explicit environment — never of the runner image.
- **Deterministic.** Same inputs produce a byte-identical env file: sorted
  names, no timestamps.
- **Secrets stay out of the report.** The JSON report carries secret *names*
  only. The env file is the single delivery artifact for values, written
  owner-only (0600).

## Invocation

```
python3 resolve.py --mode {bind|run}
                   --descriptor .spi/service.yaml
                   --facts <spi-info.json>
                   --env-file <out.env>
                   [--suite <name>]
                   [--secrets <name-to-value.json>]
                   [--expect-gateway <url>]
                   [--expect-partition <name>]
                   [--report <path>]

python3 resolve.py --contract-only
                   --descriptor .spi/service.yaml
                   [--suite <name>]
                   [--report <path>]
```

The composite `action.yml` wraps exactly the first invocation. `--suite`
selects which of the descriptor's named suites to resolve, `acceptance` by
default; the whole descriptor is validated either way, and a name it does not
declare exits 2. `--contract-only` validates the descriptor and reports the
contract fields (suite path, Maven argv, requires, secret names, and every
suite's path) with no facts, no resolution, and no env file. It is how the
build lane reads the descriptor where no environment exists, to select the
suite modules the acceptance image bakes, and how the deploy lane enumerates
the suites to run. Descriptor violations exit 2 exactly as in the full modes.

## Modes: two audiences

| Mode | Audience | Missing answer |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `bind` | A developer iterating against a personal stack | Warn, omit the entry, still write the env file, exit 0 |
| `run` | The CI lane about to execute the suite | Refuse: exit 3 naming every unresolved binding; no env file, and a stale one at the path is removed |

## Source vocabulary (closed)

A binding's `source` must be one of the following. Anything else exits 2
naming the offending key — the resolver refuses to guess.

| Source | Resolves to |
| --- | --- |
| `gateway` | `base_url` from facts, trailing slash stripped, then `suffix` appended |
| `partition` | The primary entry's `name` in `partitions[]` |
| `openid` | `azure.openid_issuer` — the OIDC v2.0 issuer URL, published explicitly by the stack, never derived from the tenant id here |
| `tenant` | `azure.tenant_id` |
| `legalTag` | The primary entry's `legal_tag` in `partitions[]` (legal tags are partition-scoped) |
| `domain` | `entitlements_domain` — the entitlements domain the stack deployed |
| `keyvault:<name>` | The value of that secret from the caller's secrets file; the vault itself is named by `azure.keyvault` in facts |
| `static` | The declared `value`, verbatim |
| `template` | The declared `value` with `${NAME}` references to other bindings, rendered after everything else resolves; may only reference non-template, non-secret bindings |
| `user` | Nothing — the caller's environment must supply it (or a declared `default`) |
| `token` | `RESOLVER_TOKEN`, the bearer the caller minted for this run: the deploy lane's per-run mint, or `spi token` on a laptop. No `default`: a default token is a secret in the repository |
| `memberToken` | `RESOLVER_MEMBER_TOKEN`, the bearer minted for the stack's member identity, a plain user in `users` and each service's user group with no admin rights: the lane's per-run mint, or `spi token --member` on a laptop. Same rules as `token` |
| `noAccessToken` | `RESOLVER_NO_ACCESS_TOKEN`, the bearer minted for the stack's no-access identity: the lane's per-run mint, or `spi token --no-access` on a laptop. Same rules as `token` |

The fact locations live in one table (`FACT_PATHS` / `PARTITION_FACT_KEYS`),
so an envelope rename is a one-line change. A fact an environment does not
publish resolves as env-not-ready in run mode.

## Resolution precedence

Per variable: **explicit process environment → source resolution → declared
`default`.** An explicit environment value wins verbatim — no suffix is
appended — which is what lets a developer point one variable at localhost
without forking the contract. `template` sources render last, from the
already-resolved map.

A variable set to the **empty string** counts as unset, deliberately: CI
materializes empty strings from undefined workflow variables, and a blank
override silently erasing a live fact is exactly the failure mode typed
refusals exist to prevent. An intentionally empty value is expressible in
the contract itself (`default: ""`).

## The agreement point

Where the caller and the facts could both answer the same question, one owns
it and the other asserts agreement. If `--expect-gateway` or
`--expect-partition` is passed **and** facts publish that value, a mismatch is
a typed infra error (exit 4) — never a silent preference. Gateway comparison
ignores trailing slashes.

A caller that knows its target SHOULD pass the expect flags: the CI lane
knows exactly what it pinned where, so it asserts both and injects no
per-binding overrides, which makes the cross-check govern in CI. The
developer loop may omit them — there, per-binding explicit environment wins
by design.

## Guard rails

- **Reserved environment names** are rejected at validation: exact names
  (`AZURE_CLIENT_ID`, `AZURE_TENANT_ID`, `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID`,
  `AZURE_FEDERATED_TOKEN_FILE`, plus process basics such as `PATH`, `HOME`,
  `LD_PRELOAD`, `MAVEN_OPTS`) and prefixes (`ACTIONS_`, `GITHUB_`, `RESOLVER_`, `RUNNER_`,
  `SPI_STACK_`).
- **`mavenArguments` is an argv array.** Each token must be free of
  whitespace and control characters; consumers pass the decoded array
  directly to Maven and never evaluate it as a shell string.
- **Secret values can never live in the descriptor**: `keyvault:` sources
  take no `default` and no `value`; `keyVaultBindings` map to secret names
  only.
- **Resolved values must be env-file safe**: a control character in any
  resolved value (facts included) is a typed infra error, because
  `docker run --env-file` cannot carry it.

## Exit codes

| Code | Category | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | — | Resolved (bind mode may carry warnings) |
| 2 | `descriptor` | Contract violation: unknown key or source, reserved name, bad shape. The descriptor author must fix the file. |
| 3 | `env-not-ready` | Run mode: a required answer is missing (unpublished fact, unsupplied secret, unset `user` variable). Deploy gates report this, tests never start. |
| 4 | `infra` | The environment answered wrongly: facts envelope unreadable, wrong `apiVersion`, or malformed (wrong-typed values, non-mapping nodes, more than one primary partition), agreement mismatch, unsafe value. Only an *absent* fact reads as env-not-ready. |

## Report schema (v1)

Written to `--report` (and always attempted, even on failure):

```json
{
  "engine_version": "1.1.0",
  "report_schema": 1,
  "mode": "bind",
  "service": "partition",
  "contract": {
    "suite": "acceptance",
    "suites": {"acceptance": "partition-acceptance-test", "integration": "testing"},
    "test_type": "maven",
    "test_dir": "partition-acceptance-test",
    "maven_arguments": ["verify"],
    "timeout_minutes": 25,
    "requires": {"loads": [], "groups": []},
    "dependencies": []
  },
  "key_vault": {"vault": "kv-name-from-facts", "secret_names": []},
  "agreement_checked": ["gateway"],
  "resolved_names": ["MY_TENANT", "PARTITION_BASE_URL"],
  "missing": [{"name": "LEGAL_TAG", "reason": "fact 'legalTag' is not published by this environment"}],
  "error": null
}
```

On failure `error` carries `{category, code, detail}` and the exit code
follows the category.

## The descriptor, by example

```yaml
# .spi/service.yaml — fork-owned, reviewed with the code, survives any stack rehome
schemaVersion: 3
service: { name: partition, archetype: java-maven-azure }
tests:                                  # named suites of one shape; acceptance is required
  acceptance:
    type: maven
    path: partition-acceptance-test     # upstream-maintained module, kept by the filter
    mavenArguments: [verify]
    bindings:                           # symbols, never values — resolved against facts per run
      PARTITION_BASE_URL:  { source: gateway, suffix: / }
      MY_TENANT:           { source: partition }
      TEST_OPENID_PROVIDER_URL: { source: openid }
      LEGAL_TAG:           { source: legalTag }
      CLIENT_TENANT:       { source: tenant }
      INTEGRATION_TESTER_TOKEN: { source: token }  # minted per run, never stored
      SEARCH_URL:          { source: template, value: "${PARTITION_BASE_URL}api/search/v2/" }
    keyVaultBindings: {}                # env name -> Key Vault secret NAME, resolved at run time
    requires:                           # checked against published load facts by the deploy gate
      loads: []
      groups: []
    dependencies: []                    # sibling services this suite calls
    timeoutMinutes: 25
  integration:                          # a fork-owned suite, selected with --suite integration
    type: maven
    path: testing
    mavenArguments: [-pl, partition-test-azure, -am, test]
    bindings:
      PARTITION_BASE_URL: { source: gateway, suffix: / }
      MY_TENANT:          { source: partition }
      INTEGRATION_TESTER_ACCESS_TOKEN: { source: token }
```

Suite names are lowercase slugs. The formal contract is `service-descriptor.schema.json` beside this file. The
descriptor accepts a fixed YAML subset (block and flow mappings/lists, quoted
or plain scalars, comments — no anchors, no multi-line scalars, no tabs),
parsed by the engine itself so the contract never depends on the runner image.

## Local testing

```bash
cd .github/actions/acceptance-resolver

# facts from a live stack…
spi info --json > /tmp/info.json
# …or any saved fixture
python3 resolve.py --mode bind --descriptor /path/to/.spi/service.yaml \
                   --facts /tmp/info.json --env-file /tmp/acceptance.env \
                   --report /tmp/report.json
cat /tmp/acceptance.env

# explicit env always wins — point one variable at a laptop service
PARTITION_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080/ python3 resolve.py --mode bind ...
```

The regression harness lives at
`.github/local-actions/acceptance-resolver-tests/run-tests.sh` and runs
against fixture facts — no cluster, no Azure calls.
