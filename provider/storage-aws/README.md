# Storage Service
storage-aws is a [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) service that provides a set of APIs to manage metadata record storage and retrieval. 


## Running Locally

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Run Locally
Check that maven is installed:

example:
```bash
$ mvn --version
Apache Maven 3.8.3 (ff8e977a158738155dc465c6a97ffaf31982d739)
Maven home: /usr/local/Cellar/maven/3.8.3/libexec
Java version: 17.0.7
...
```

You may need to configure access to the remote maven repository that holds the OSDU dependencies. Copy one of the below files' content to your .m2 folder
* For development against the OSDU GitLab environment, leverage: `<REPO_ROOT>~/.mvn/community-maven.settings.xml`
* For development in an AWS Environment, leverage: `<REPO_ROOT>/provider/storage-aws/maven/settings.xml`

* Navigate to the service's root folder and run:

```bash
mvn clean package -pl storage-core,provider/storage-aws
```

* If you wish to build the project without running tests

```bash
mvn clean package -pl storage-core,provider/storage-aws -DskipTests
```

After configuring your environment as specified above, you can follow these steps to run the application. These steps should be invoked from the *repository root.*
<br/>
<br/>
NOTE: If not on osx/linux: Replace `*` with version numbers as defined in the provider/storage-aws/pom.xml file

```bash
java -jar provider/storage-aws/target/storage-aws-*.*.*-SNAPSHOT-spring-boot.jar
```

## Testing

 **Creating a new user to use for integration tests**
 ```
 aws cognito-idp admin-create-user --user-pool-id ${AWS_COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID} --username ${AWS_COGNITO_AUTH_PARAMS_USER} --user-attributes Name=email,Value=${AWS_COGNITO_AUTH_PARAMS_USER} Name=email_verified,Value=True --message-action SUPPRESS

 aws cognito-idp initiate-auth --auth-flow ${AWS_COGNITO_AUTH_FLOW} --client-id ${AWS_COGNITO_CLIENT_ID} --auth-parameters USERNAME=${AWS_COGNITO_AUTH_PARAMS_USER},PASSWORD=${AWS_COGNITO_AUTH_PARAMS_PASSWORD}
 ```
 
 **Entitlements group configuration for integration accounts**
 <br/>
 In order to add user entitlements, run entitlements bootstrap scripts in the entitlements project
 
 | AWS_COGNITO_AUTH_PARAMS_USER | AWS_COGNITO_AUTH_PARAMS_USER_NO_ACCESS | 
 | ---  | --- |
 | service.entitlements.user | service.entitlements.user |
 | service.storage.admin | service.storage.admin
 | service.storage.editor |
 | service.storage.viewer |
 | service.legal.admin |
 | service.legal.editor |
 | data.test1 | 
 | data.integration.test |
 
 Execute following command to build code and run all the integration tests:

### Run Tests simulating Pipeline

* Prior to running tests, scripts must be executed locally to generate pipeline env vars

```bash
testing/storage-test-aws/build-aws/prepare-dist.sh

#Set Neccessary ENV Vars here as defined in run-tests.sh

dist/testing/integration/build-aws/run-tests.sh 
```

### Run Tests using mvn
Set required env vars and execute the following:
```
mvn clean package -f testing/pom.xml -pl storage-test-core,storage-test-aws -DskipTests
mvn test -f testing/storage-test-aws/pom.xml
```
