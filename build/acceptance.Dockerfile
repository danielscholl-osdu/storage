# Canonical test-suite image, owned by the engineering system and synced to every fork
# (ADR-037 posture). Bakes every suite the descriptor declares from the same commit as the
# service image, with each suite's dependencies prewarmed, so the tests that shipped with a
# release stay one command later:
#
#   docker run --env-file .env -e SUITE_DIR=<path> ghcr.io/<org>/<svc>-acceptance:sha-<sha> [maven argv...]
#
# SUITE_DIR is a tests.<name>.path from .spi/service.yaml and defaults to the acceptance suite.
# The select stage carves only the declared suites, the Maven settings, and the descriptor out
# of the checkout, so the service source never ships and scanners see only what the suites use.
#
# Only the suite source and a warmed local repository are pinned. The run is online, and where
# the upstream graph carries version ranges (os-core-test pulls io.cucumber ranges) a later run
# can resolve a different set; go-offline caches artifacts, not range metadata. A fork that
# wants a frozen set pins the ranges in its own suite pom.
#
# amd64 only: this build runs Maven, and under QEMU arm64 emulation that costs minutes per push
# with no consumer. CI runners are amd64 and Apple Silicon runs the amd64 image emulated.
