# Three-Branch Strategy

The three-branch strategy gives upstream changes a controlled path into the fork. Each branch is a checkpoint, so a failure stops at the stage where it happened while synchronization continues.

## Branch Architecture

### Branch Purposes

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   :material-source-branch-check:{ .lg .middle } **`main` - Production Branch**

    ---

    Stable production branch containing successfully integrated changes

    - Required PR reviews and status checks
    - Shared and fork-owned Azure code
    - Upstream updates arrive through validated release PRs from `fork_integration`
    - Local feature and hotfix branches also merge through reviewed PRs

</div>

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   :material-source-commit:{ .lg .middle } **`fork_upstream` - Generated Upstream Tree**

    ---

    Deterministic upstream-owned tree generated from the upstream tip

    - Keeps shared core, acceptance-test, test-core, POM, documentation, and license content
    - Excludes provider source, `core-plus`, `devops/`, non-Azure tests, and upstream CI files
    - Injects POM references to Azure modules that exist only on the fork-owned branches
    - Halts when new shared content is not classified
    - Filtered from its first generation: initialization generates the branch through the engine, so the fork never carries a verbatim mirror and the Azure trees never enter the merge base

</div>

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   :material-source-merge:{ .lg .middle } **`fork_integration` - Integration Workspace**

    ---

    Where conflicts are resolved and the combined tree is validated

    - Relaxed protection so conflict resolution can push directly
    - Combines generated shared code with fork-owned Azure provider and test source
    - Automated merges from `fork_upstream` with conflict resolution
    - Azure POM version stamping plus `core,azure` build and test validation

</div>

## Process Flow

#### **Synchronize**
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as Upstream Repo
    participant FU as fork_upstream
    participant S as Sync Workflow
    participant F as Upstream Filter
    participant H as Human Reviewer
    
    S->>U: Fetch latest changes
    S->>S: Check existing sync PRs and upstream SHA
    S->>F: Generate and verify provider-less tree
    
    alt New upstream changes, no existing PR
        S->>FU: Create sync branch containing generated tree
        activate FU
        S->>S: Compose PR body from upstream commit range
        S->>S: Create new sync PR and issue
        S->>H: Notify human reviewer
    else Upstream advanced, existing PR open
        S->>FU: Update existing sync branch (force push)
        S->>S: Update PR title and description
        S->>S: Add progress comment to existing issue
        S->>H: Update notification on existing issue
    else Duplicate detected (same upstream SHA)
        S->>S: Keep existing PR and issue unchanged
    else No changes detected
        S->>S: Exit - no action needed
    end
    
    opt Human approval received
        H->>H: Review and approve
        H->>FU: Merge sync branch into fork_upstream
        S->>S: Update issue and PR state
        S->>S: Cleanup completed sync artifacts
        deactivate FU
    end
```

!!! info "Sync State Management"
    The synchronization process tracks the upstream SHA, active PR, and issue state to prevent duplicates. Before creating or updating a sync branch, the upstream filter classifies the upstream tip and halts on unknown shared content. When upstream advances while a PR is open, the existing branch is regenerated and updated.

#### **Integrate**
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant M as main
    participant FU as fork_upstream
    participant FI as fork_integration
    participant C as Cascade Workflow
    participant H as Human Reviewer
    
    C->>M: Check for local changes
    M->>FI: Merge main → fork_integration
    activate FI
    C->>FU: Check for upstream updates
    FU->>FI: Merge fork_upstream → fork_integration
    C->>FI: Assert Azure trees and stamp POM versions
    C->>FI: Build and test core,azure
    C->>C: Create main PR
    
    alt Validation Conflicts/Failures
        C->>C: Create conflict resolution issue
        C->>H: Notify about conflicts
        H->>FI: Push conflict resolution to fork_integration
    end
    
    C->>FI: Run validation suite
    C->>H: Notify human reviewer
    H->>H: Review and approve
    FI->>M: Merge to main
    deactivate FI
```

#### **Release**
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant M as main
    participant R as Release Workflow
    participant H as Human Reviewer
    participant DR as Downstream Repo
    
    M->>R: Push to main triggers release
    R->>R: Analyze commits for version bump
    R->>M: Create release branch with CHANGELOG.md
    activate M
    R->>H: Create release PR
    R->>M: Run validation suite
    H->>H: Review and approve
    H->>M: Merge release branch into main
    deactivate M
    R->>R: Create release & tags
    
    alt Downstream Consumption
        DR->>M: Pull desired release tag
    end
```

A downstream repository does not have to stop at pulling release tags. It can be a customer-tier fork running this same three-branch machinery in mirror mode: `fork_upstream` becomes a verbatim mirror of this repository's `main`, the cascade integrates it with the downstream's local work, and contribution PRs flow back through the fork network. See [Fork Tiers](fork_tiers.md) and ADR-039.

## Safety Mechanisms

### Branch Protection Rules

| Protection Setting | :material-source-branch: *main* | :material-source-branch: *fork_upstream* | :material-source-branch: *fork_integration* |
|-------------------|-------|---------------|------------------|
| **Required Reviews** | 1 minimum | Not required | Not required |
| **Status Checks** | `CodeQL`, `Validation Summary` | Not required | Not required |
| **Up-to-date Branch** | Required | Not enforced | Not enforced |
| **Force Push** | Blocked | Allowed | Allowed |
| **Expected Writers** | Reviewed PRs | Sync automation | Cascade and cleanup automation |

### Quality Gates

!!! check "Integration Validation"
    ✓ **Build Verification**: `core,azure` compilation and dependency resolution
    ✓ **Test Execution**: Unit tests plus compile-only validation of the separate Azure testing reactor
    ✓ **Container Validation**: Canonical Dockerfile build on branches that contain the Azure JAR
    ✓ **Security Scanning**: CodeQL reports through its separate workflow

!!! warning "Production Validation"
    ⚠️ **Human Review**: a reviewer approves every PR to `main`  
    ⚠️ **Release Notes**: Release Please records the change in the changelog

## Workflow Benefits

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   :material-target:{ .lg .middle } **Conflict Isolation**

    ---

    Merge conflicts are resolved in the dedicated `fork_integration` branch, preventing disruption to the stable `main` branch during resolution.

-   :material-magnify:{ .lg .middle } **Clear Change Attribution**

    ---

    Clear separation between generated upstream-owned shared code and fork-owned Azure implementation changes.

-   :material-shield-account:{ .lg .middle } **Multi-Stage Validation**

    ---

    Review and validation at each stage catch problems before they reach `main`.

-   :material-history:{ .lg .middle } **Upstream Tracking**

    ---

    Reproducible filtered commits retain upstream history and record the upstream SHA and filter revision.

-   :material-backup-restore:{ .lg .middle } **Rollback Capability**

    ---

    A bad integration can be reverted on `main` without losing the upstream sync state.

## Operational Patterns

### Daily Synchronization Cycle

**Automated Processing:**

:material-arrow-right: **Step 1:** Check Upstream - Daily automated check for new upstream changes  
:material-arrow-right: **Step 2:** Filter Transform - Regenerate and verify the upstream-owned tree
:material-arrow-right: **Step 3:** Sync Review - Review and merge the filtered PR to `fork_upstream`
:material-arrow-right: **Step 4:** Cascade - Merge into integration, stamp Azure POMs, and run validation

**Human Intervention Points:**

:material-arrow-right: **Step 1:** Sync Review - Merge the sync PR into `fork_upstream`  
:material-arrow-right: **Step 2:** Conflict Resolution - Resolve on `fork_integration` when the cascade merge fails  
:material-arrow-right: **Step 3:** Production Approval - Approve the release PR to `main`  
:material-arrow-right: **Step 4:** Release - Merge the Release Please PR when the version is ready

!!! info "Release Strategy"
    The cascade opens its PR to `main` from a temporary `release/upstream-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS` branch, which is deleted after merge, so `fork_integration` itself is never the PR head.
