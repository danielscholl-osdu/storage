# Fork Lifecycle

Create, initialize, onboard, and test a service repository. This page covers the service repository tier described in [Fork Tiers](../architecture/fork_tiers.md): a repository created from this template inside the organization that owns the service. A customer fork follows [Customer Fork Adoption](../workflows/adoption.md) instead.

Each step ends with an expected result. Check it before you move on.

## Prerequisites

- `gh` signed in as an admin of the GitHub organization that will hold the repository, so you can create it and read its variables.
- `RELEASE_APP_ID` and `RELEASE_APP_PRIVATE_KEY` set as organization secrets, or ready to set on the repository as [Initialization](../workflows/initialization.md) describes.
- The GitHub App those secrets belong to installed on the repository. An app installed on selected repositories does not cover a new one, and `Initialize Complete` fails at its first step, "Generate GitHub App Token", until it does. In the Azure organization this is an installation request through the OSPO process, so file it as soon as the repository exists.
- The `spi` CLI, installed from a release of `Azure/osdu-spi-stack` and connected to the stack environment the repository will test against: run `spi connect --resource-group <rg> --cluster <cluster>`, then check that `spi status` reports the environment as deployable.
- `az` signed in to the subscription that holds that environment, with rights to update federated credentials on its three identities: the deploy, member, and no-access identities.

## Create and initialize

### 1. Create the repository from the template

```bash
gh repo create <org>/<service> --template Azure/osdu-spi --public
```

**Expected result:** within a minute, the repository has an open issue titled "Repository Initialization Required".

### 2. Configure the upstream repository

First set the reviewers for the fork. The default-branch ruleset requires a code-owner review, and one person cannot approve their own pull requests, so name a team (or two or more people) with write access:

```bash
gh variable set CODEOWNERS --repo <org>/<service> --body "@<org>/<team>"
```

Then reply to the initialization issue with the upstream repository: a full URL for GitLab, or `owner/name` for GitHub. Leave off `.git`; initialization adds it.

```
https://community.opengroup.org/osdu/platform/system/<service>
```

The reply starts the `Initialize Complete` workflow, which takes four to six minutes. It creates the filtered `fork_upstream` branch, adds the Azure provider and test code to `fork_integration`, deploys the fork workflows, applies the rulesets, and closes the issue.

**Expected result:** the issue is closed, the repository has the `main`, `fork_upstream`, and `fork_integration` branches, `UPSTREAM_REPO_URL` names the upstream, `INITIALIZATION_COMPLETE` is `true`, and `.github/CODEOWNERS` names the `CODEOWNERS` value as the owner of every path. If the variable was not set, the file is absent and the Settings Apply run opens a human-required issue; set the variable and the next template sync plants it. The file is fork-owned after planting.

```bash
gh api repos/<org>/<service>/branches --jq '.[].name'
gh variable list --repo <org>/<service>
```

**If the issue reports a filter halt** instead, the upstream tree has something the filter config does not classify, and the comment names it. Add the entry to the template's `.github/fork-resources/upstream-filter.yml` when every service carries it, or commit a complete `.github/upstream-filter.yml` to this repository's `main` when it is specific to this service. In that file, `service` is the Maven module prefix, which initialization reads from `provider/<prefix>-azure` upstream; it equals the repository name only by convention, and `entitlements`, whose modules are `entitlements-v2-*`, is the standing exception. Then post the upstream repository on the issue again. A retry converges on the branches a partial run left behind.

### 3. Add the service descriptor

The deploy lane reads `.spi/service.yaml` to learn which test suites to build into the acceptance image and run. Clone the repository and create a branch for the descriptor:

```bash
gh repo clone <org>/<service>
cd <service>
git switch -c add-service-descriptor
```

Write `.spi/service.yaml` as [Service Descriptor](service-descriptor.md) describes. Then commit it and open a pull request against `main`:

```bash
git add .spi/service.yaml
git commit -m "chore: add service descriptor"
git push -u origin add-service-descriptor
gh pr create --base main --fill
```

Leave the pull request open; step 5 uses it.

**Expected result:** the Deploy Gate job reports "repository is not onboarded to a stack" and lists the five missing values. This is expected before onboarding, and the Validation Summary check still passes.

## Onboard to a stack environment

Onboarding lets the repository's workflows borrow the stack environment. A borrow deploys a candidate image of the service to the stack, runs the descriptor's suites against it, and restores the canonical image afterward.

### 4. Onboard the repository

Run the onboarding plan first. It changes nothing:

```bash
spi onboard <service> --repo <org>/<service>
```

The plan has three groups of rows: the repository values and its `spi-stack` environment, the federated credentials on the environment's deploy, member, and no-access identities, and the trusted-repositories annotation on the cluster. For a new repository, every row reads missing. For a repository recreated under a name that was onboarded before, the credentials read drifted: the OIDC subject includes the repository id, and recreating the repository changed the id. For a repository onboarded before its environment provisioned the member identity, only the member credential reads missing. In each case, apply the plan:

```bash
spi onboard <service> --repo <org>/<service> --write
```

**Expected result:** running the plan again shows every row as correct, and the repository has the five values:

```bash
gh variable list --repo <org>/<service>
gh secret list --repo <org>/<service>
```

`AZURE_TENANT_ID`, `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID`, `SPI_STACK_RESOURCE_GROUP`, and `SPI_STACK_CLUSTER` are variables; `AZURE_CLIENT_ID` is a secret.

Onboarding can't test the credential itself, because only a workflow run in the repository's `spi-stack` environment can get the repository's OIDC token. Step 5 tests it.

### 5. Test a change in the environment

The descriptor pull request itself triggers a build, because Check Paths treats `.spi/` as build-relevant. Changes under `provider/`, `testing/`, `.mvn/`, or `.spi/`, or to a `pom.xml`, trigger a build. A pull request that changes only `.github/`, `devops/`, `docs/`, other dot-directories, or Markdown files skips the build and deploys nothing.

**Expected result:** the Deploy and Test job runs, and its "Log in as deploy identity" step succeeds, which confirms the federated credential. The Validation Summary comment on the pull request lists every job and one result line per suite. The job's Restore step returns the service to its canonical image.

Merge the pull request. The push to `main` runs the deploy lane again with the image built from the merge.

## Operate the repository

- **Pull requests that push an image borrow the environment.** A docs-only change skips the build and deploys nothing. Pull requests queue behind each other in a per-service concurrency group, so only one run at a time deploys the service.
- **Pull requests from other repositories never borrow.** The Deploy Gate reports why. To test such a change, a maintainer pushes it to a branch in this repository.
- **Check for drift** by running `spi onboard <service> --repo <org>/<service>` without `--write`. Run it when the "Log in as deploy identity" step starts failing.
- **Require approval before each borrow** by adding a required reviewer to the repository's `spi-stack` environment in its settings. The workflow needs no change.

## Remove from the environment

### 6. Remove the repository from the environment

The first command shows what will be removed; the second removes it:

```bash
spi onboard <service> --remove
spi onboard <service> --remove --write
```

**Expected result:** `spi onboard --list` no longer lists the repository for the service. The repository's own values and `spi-stack` environment stay in place.
