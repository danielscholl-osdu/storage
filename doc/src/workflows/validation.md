# Pull Request Validation Workflow

The validation workflow supplies the required checks on protected branches. It verifies that a change builds and that the PR meets process requirements before merge.

The validation system applies different build rules by context. Sync PRs targeting the provider-less `fork_upstream` tree build `core` only and skip the image jobs; other Java changes build the Azure profile set, validate a service image, and, once the fork is onboarded to a stack, deploy and test it.

## When It Runs

The validation workflow runs on:

- **Every pull request** to a protected branch (`main`, `fork_integration`, `fork_upstream`)
- **Direct pushes** to protected branches, where the rulesets permit them
- **Manual trigger** for a check during setup or troubleshooting

The workflow declares both `pull_request` and `pull_request_target`, and routes each PR to exactly one lane. Same-repository `sync/` branches take `pull_request_target`, which reads the workflow from the default branch; in filter mode that is the only lane, because neither `fork_upstream` nor the sync branch carries workflows. Every other PR takes `pull_request`. The unused lane reports skipped, so exactly one `Validation Summary` context reflects a real build.

## What Gets Validated

Validation covers four areas:

### Code Quality Validation
The system verifies that code compiles, dependencies resolve, and tests pass. Pull-request builds can generate JaCoCo coverage reports. Documentation and configuration-only PRs keep the required summary checks reporting while skipping the heavy Java and container jobs.

### Process Compliance Verification
Beyond code quality, the workflow validates semantic PR titles for ordinary PRs to `main`, detects whitespace/conflict-marker errors, and verifies that PR branches are up to date.

### Security and Dependency Analysis
CodeQL runs in its own workflow and supplies the required `CodeQL` status. Dependabot PRs use `dependabot-validation.yml` for one Java build with coverage followed by validate-only container construction; they do not run the regular Java and container jobs in this workflow.

### Deploy and Test
On a push to `main` or `fork_integration`, and on the fork's own pull requests, the lane borrows the service's slot in the attached stack, proves the pushed image with every suite `.spi/service.yaml` declares, and restores the canonical image (ADR-041). A gate job ahead of it always reports, so a run without the lane says why: a pull request from another repository, a fork not yet onboarded, no descriptor, or no image pushed.

## Validation Results

The summary job posts one comment on the pull request, updated in place on every push: a table of every job with its result and the reason for any skip, followed by one line per suite the lane ran, and a link to the run. A failed suite names its failure count there; the Surefire and Failsafe reports are attached to the run as the `suite-reports` artifact. Pull requests from other repositories and from Dependabot get no comment, because their token cannot write one, and sync PRs on the `pull_request_target` lane never had one; the checks list and run summary carry the same content.

When every check passes the PR can merge once a reviewer approves it. When a check fails the PR is blocked; the failing check links to the job log with the reason.

## How to Fix Common Issues

### Build Failures
```bash
# Run build locally to debug
mvn clean install -P core,azure

# Check for missing dependencies
mvn dependency:tree
```

### PR Title Issues

Edit the pull request title to use a supported Conventional Commit type, for example `feat: add new feature description`.

### Test Failures
```bash
# Run tests locally
mvn test -P core,azure

# Run specific test class
mvn test -P core,azure -Dtest=TestClassName

# Run with coverage report
mvn test -P core,azure jacoco:report
```

### Merge Conflicts
```bash
# Update your branch with target branch
git fetch origin
git merge origin/main  # or target branch

# Resolve conflicts in IDE
# Then commit resolution
git add .
git commit -m "resolve: merge conflicts with main"
```

## Validation Jobs

The workflow coordinates the following validation jobs:

| Job | Purpose | What It Checks |
|-----|---------|----------------|
| **Check Initialization** | Verifies repository setup | Ensures workflows are properly deployed |
| **Check Repository** | Detects project type | Identifies Java projects via `pom.xml` |
| **Check Paths** | Avoids unnecessary work; enforces ownership | Skips heavy jobs for docs/config-only PRs; fails PRs to `main` that touch a file owned by `origin/fork_upstream` (ADR-038) |
| **Java Build** | Compiles and tests | Uses `core,azure` by default; `core` on `fork_upstream` |
| **Docker Build** | Validates both images | Builds the canonical service and test-suite Dockerfiles without registry credentials |
| **Docker Push** | Publishes trusted builds | Pushes multi-arch SHA and branch tags to public GHCR, with the test-suite image beside them |
| **Deploy Gate** | Decides whether to borrow | Always reports; names the reason when the lane does not run |
| **Deploy and Test** | Proves the pushed image | Borrow, prove every declared suite, restore |
| **Check Code Quality** | Process compliance | Semantic PR title, conflict markers, branch status |
| **Validation Summary** | Required status | Always reports; one table of every job, its result, and any skip reason, posted on the pull request |

## Branch-Specific Rules

All protected branches use the same validation rules, with exemptions for specific PR types:

| Branch | Standard Validation | Exemptions |
|--------|-------------------|------------|
| **`main`** | Azure Maven, image validation, deploy and test + human approval | Docs/config-only changes skip heavy jobs |
| **`fork_integration`** | Azure Maven, image validation, deploy and test | Docs/config-only changes skip heavy jobs |
| **`fork_upstream`** | Core-only Maven validation | No Azure JAR or container image exists on this branch, so nothing to deploy |
| **Feature branches** | N/A - not protected | Standard PR validation, including deploy and test, when targeting protected branches |

## Special Cases

### Sync PRs
- **Relaxed commit standards** - Upstream commits may not follow conventions
- **Single lane** - `pull_request_target` owns sync PRs and supplies trusted local actions; it builds `core` only in filter mode and the full profile set in mirror mode. The validate-only image build never runs in this lane (#164); it runs on the cascade PR (and, in mirror mode, on the `fork_upstream` push after merge)

## Status Check Details

### Required Checks on `main`
- `CodeQL` - Stable summary from the separate CodeQL workflow
- `Validation Summary` - Stable summary covering the Java build, both image builds, the push, and the deploy lane; code quality stays advisory

The integration-branch ruleset does not currently require status checks.

### Check Exemptions
- **Sync PRs**: Build `core` only and skip image validation
- **Release and automation PRs**: Skip semantic PR-title validation
- **Dependabot PRs**: Build with coverage and validate the image through `dependabot-validation.yml`. A bump that edits an upstream-owned file, typically an inherited version in the root `pom.xml`, is closed by that workflow with a comment instead of building (ADR-026, ADR-038)
- **Docs/config-only PRs**: Changes limited to `.github/**`, `devops/**`, `docs/**`, other dotfiles, or Markdown skip Java and container work while summary checks still report. `.mvn/**` and `.spi/**` are never config-only, so a change there always passes the path filter and the build runs; the branch and deploy-gate rules above still apply
- **Upstream-owned files on a PR to `main`**: Check Paths fails when a changed file exists on `origin/fork_upstream` (ADR-038), unless the PR carries the `port` label declaring a deliberate port (add the label and re-run Check Paths; a fork initialized before the label existed creates it once with `gh label create port`, as the template-sync labels issue for that fork also notes), targets a branch other than `main`, or is a `fork_integration`/`release/upstream-*` head, mirror mode, or a fork with no `.github/upstream-filter.yml`
- **Pull requests from other repositories**: Build and validate only; the deploy lane skips because such a run carries no deploy identity

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| "Initialization check failed" | Repository not properly set up | Ensure workflows are deployed and `pom.xml` exists |
| "Java build failed" | Compilation or dependency issues | Run `mvn clean install` locally, check dependency conflicts |
| "Unit tests failing" | Test failures in Maven build | Run `mvn test` locally, fix failing test cases |
| "Semantic PR validation failed" | PR title doesn't follow the supported format | Use a title such as `feat:`, `fix:`, or `chore:` |
| "Merge conflicts detected" | Git conflict markers found | Resolve conflicts locally and commit resolution |
| "Repository not initialized" | Missing required setup files | Complete repository initialization first |
| "Branch status validation failed" | Branch protection or merge issues | Ensure branch is up to date with target |
| "Deploy and Test skipped" | The gate declined; the notice names why | Onboard the fork with `spi onboard`, add `.spi/service.yaml`, or open the PR from a branch in this repository |
| "environment is not deployable after 10 minutes" | The stack stayed in maintenance, or another service's lane held it, for longer than the lane waits | Check `spi status` for the reason; rerun once it reports deployable |

## Configuration

### Commit Message Format
```
type(scope): description

feat: add new feature
fix: resolve bug in component
docs: update API documentation
chore: update dependencies
```

### Container Configuration

The engineering system syncs the canonical `build/Dockerfile` to every fork. `SERVICE_NAME` defaults to the repository name, and `SERVICE_TARGET_JAR` is needed only to disambiguate multiple Azure Spring Boot JARs. Trusted pushes publish to `ghcr.io/<owner>/<service>` with the workflow `GITHUB_TOKEN`; untrusted PR contexts never receive package-write permission.

Two more images are built beside the service image from the same commit and skipped when their inputs are absent: `<service>-acceptance` from the suites the descriptor declares (ADR-040), and `<service>-load` from `deployments/shared-schemas/` when the fork's filter keeps it (ADR-042). Only the schema fork carries that payload.
