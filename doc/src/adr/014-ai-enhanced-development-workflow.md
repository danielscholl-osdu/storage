# ADR-014: AI-Enhanced Development Workflow Integration

## Status
**Superseded** - 2026-09-01 by the removal in #162.

The AI path never worked in production. `aipr pr` ran inside a `git worktree add --detach`
worktree and crashed on `repo.active_branch.name`; `sync-template.yml` never installed the
tool at all. Every failure was swallowed by `2>&1` capture and `|| echo ""`, so the
"graceful degradation" below was the only path that ever executed, for the entire life of
the reference fork, across eight months of green daily runs. Reviewers merged the fallback
bodies without complaint.

Descriptions are now deterministic. The meta-commit classification this ADR delegated to a
model is a rule (see ADR-023). No replacement model was adopted: GitHub Models was retired
2026-07-30, the Copilot coding-agent API rejects GitHub App installation tokens, and
Copilot's PR summary has no API surface.

## Context

Modern development workflows can benefit significantly from AI assistance, particularly in areas like code analysis, security scanning, and documentation generation. As we developed the fork management template system, we identified opportunities to integrate AI capabilities that would enhance the development experience while maintaining workflow reliability.

**AI Integration Opportunities:**

- **Pull Request Enhancement**: Generate PR descriptions using AI analysis of code changes
- **Security Analysis**: AI-powered triage of vulnerability scans to provide actionable insights
- **Change Summarization**: Summaries of template updates and upstream changes
- **Documentation Generation**: AI-assisted creation of commit messages and change logs

**Requirements for AI Integration:**

- **Optional Enhancement**: AI should enhance workflows without being required for basic functionality
- **Azure Foundry Primary**: Standardize on Azure Foundry as the primary AI provider
- **Graceful Degradation**: Workflows must function normally when AI services are unavailable
- **Cost Management**: Usage patterns to control API costs
- **Security**: Safe handling of API keys and sensitive data

**Technical Challenges:**

- **Environment Consistency**: AI tools need consistent environments across GitHub Actions
- **API Key Management**: Secure handling of multiple AI provider credentials
- **Error Handling**: Fallback when AI services fail or are unavailable

## Decision

Implement **AI-Enhanced Development Workflow Integration** with the following architecture:

### 1. **Azure Foundry Integration**

- **Primary Provider**: Azure Foundry for enterprise compliance and Microsoft ecosystem integration
- **Provider Detection**: Automatic detection based on available Azure API keys
- **Fallback Strategy**: Graceful degradation to structured templates when Azure is unavailable

### 2. **AI PR Generator (aipr) Integration**

```bash
# Install AI PR generator
pip install pr-generator-agent>=1.4.0

# Generate PR description with vulnerability analysis
aipr generate --from upstream/main \
  --vulns --max-lines 20000 \
  --context "upstream sync"
```

### 3. **Workflow Enhancement Points**

- **Upstream Sync**: AI-generated PR descriptions for upstream changes
- **Template Sync**: Intelligent analysis of template updates
- **Security Triage**: Vulnerability scan analysis and prioritization
- **Commit Generation**: Conventional commit messages from changesets

### 4. **Provider Configuration**

```yaml
env:
  # Azure Foundry Configuration (Required for AI features)
  AZURE_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.AZURE_API_KEY }}
  AZURE_API_BASE: ${{ secrets.AZURE_API_BASE }}
  AZURE_API_VERSION: ${{ secrets.AZURE_API_VERSION }}
```

### 5. **Fallback Mechanisms**

- **Structured Templates**: Pre-defined PR templates when AI is unavailable
- **Base64 Encoding**: Large content fallback for template PRs
- **Manual Override**: Human-editable descriptions for all AI-generated content

## Implementation

### AI Provider Detection Logic

```bash
USE_LLM=false
LLM_MODEL=""

# Check for Azure Foundry API key
if [[ -n "$AZURE_API_KEY" ]] && [[ -n "$AZURE_API_BASE" ]]; then
  USE_LLM=true
  LLM_MODEL="azure"
  echo "Using Azure Foundry for PR description generation"
else
  echo "No Azure Foundry configured - using fallback templates"
fi
```

### Workflow Integration Pattern

```yaml
- name: Generate AI-Enhanced PR Description
  if: env.USE_LLM == 'true'
  run: |
    aipr generate \
      --from ${{ github.base_ref }} \
      --vulns \
      --max-lines 20000 \
      --context "upstream synchronization" \
      > pr_description.md

- name: Use Fallback Template
  if: env.USE_LLM != 'true'
  run: |
    cat > pr_description.md << 'EOF'
    ## Upstream Synchronization

    This PR synchronizes changes from the upstream repository.

    ### Changes
    - Updated from upstream commit: ${{ env.UPSTREAM_SHA }}
    - Diff size: ${{ env.DIFF_SIZE }} lines

    ### Review Checklist
    - [ ] Changes reviewed for compatibility
    - [ ] Tests passing
    - [ ] No security issues identified
    EOF
```

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Enhanced PR Quality**: AI-generated descriptions provide change analysis
- **Reduced Manual Work**: Automated generation of conventional commits and PR descriptions
- **Security Insights**: AI-powered vulnerability triage provides actionable recommendations
- **Enterprise Integration**: Azure Foundry provides compliance and Microsoft ecosystem alignment
- **Cost Control**: Usage limits and fallback mechanisms control API costs

### Negative

- **API Dependencies**: Requires Azure Foundry API keys for full functionality
- **Single Provider**: Standardization on Azure means no fallback to other AI providers
- **Cost Considerations**: AI API usage incurs costs that need monitoring
- **Maintenance**: AI tools and models require regular updates

### Mitigations

- **Graceful Degradation**: All AI features have structured template fallbacks
- **Template Quality**: Non-AI fallbacks provide base descriptions
- **Usage Monitoring**: Track API usage to control costs
- **Documentation**: Clear Azure Foundry setup guides
